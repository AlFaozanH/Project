📞 Customer Telecom Billing and Management System (CLI)
This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application developed in C to simulate a basic telecom billing and customer record-keeping system. 
It demonstrates proficiency in file I/O, array-based data management, string manipulation, and procedural programming.

🎯 Project Goal
The primary goal was to create a functional, persistent data management system that could perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customer records, 
calculating bills based on usage and storing data in a local file.

Customer Telecom Billing System (C CLI)
This project is a robust Command-Line Interface (CLI) application developed in C to simulate a comprehensive customer management and billing solution for a telecommunications environment.

The application highlights proficiency in fundamental C concepts and system development practices:

Data Persistence: Records are managed using file I/O, allowing customer data (name, phone, usage) to be stored in and retrieved from a local text file (customers.txt).

Core Logic Implementation: The system implements a full set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, using functions to search records by phone number, update usage data, and calculate bills based on usage minutes.

Data Management: It utilizes C structs and static arrays for efficient in-memory data organization, showcasing skills in array-based data management and iteration.

Modular Design: The codebase follows procedural programming principles, employing separate functions for each feature (e.g., modifyRecord, viewPayment, deleteRecord) to ensure clarity and maintainability.
